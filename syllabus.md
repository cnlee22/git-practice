### **Course Description:** 
Statistics are quantitative (numerical) tools used to describe and analyze systematically acquired and quantitative information (data). Multivariate statistics are focused on interpreting the effects of a series of variables on a given “outcome” variable. They are most useful in any science when they are associated with the theories and concepts within a particular discipline (e.g., sociology, anthropology, criminal justice, comparative women’s studies, social work or public health). Multivariate statistical tests including models, tables and graphs are used to describe empirical observations; to test hypotheses (or answer research questions / test multivariate statistical models), to make predictions and to assess relationships among variables. 

This course is designed to familiarize students with quantitative techniques used in social sciences to investigate and make meaning of social phenomena. We will begin with a review some elementary statistics, then, then move into multivariate techniques using the general linear model.  This course places a great deal of emphasis on interpreting and understandings quantitative data produce via computer applications – specifically SPSS.

 ### **Course Objectives:** 										              
 This course aims to enhance students quantitative and statistical literacy. In doing so, students are equipped with the necessary skills to conduct statistical test on and interpret the effects of a series of independent variables (X’s) on some dependent variable (Y) using SPSS software. Emphasis is placed on selecting appropriate statistical test and analyzing real data (for example, data from the Census, Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), General Social Survey (GSS), etc.) to address social science research questions. By the end of the course, students will be able to: 
- Explain the difference between descriptive and inferential statistical techniques
- Identify when it is appropriate to use these various statistical techniques  
- Use SPSS to manipulate and analyze data. 
- Formulate and test hypotheses using specific theoretical frameworks and operational definitions.
- Conduct secondary analyses to address independent research questions.
- Communicate statistical analysis, results, and inferences.
